    title: "Trump PANICS as INFLATION HITS HIGHEST LEVEL in YEARS!",
    date: "Apr 21, 2026",
    summary: [
      "This episode is framed around inflation returning to the center of the political story and the pressure that puts on Donald Trump and his public messaging. The argument appears to treat the latest price spike as more than an economic data point, positioning it as a stress test for the broader MAGA narrative.",
      "On the site, the summary reads as a fast-turn breakdown of how inflation changes political leverage, voter patience, and the credibility of promises made only weeks earlier.",

    title: "Alex Jones CALLS FOR Trump's REMOVAL in MAGA SHOCK!",
    date: "Apr 19, 2026",
    summary: [
      "This segment is presented as a rupture inside the MAGA ecosystem, using Alex Jones's call for removal as proof that internal loyalty can fracture very quickly once strategic panic sets in. The emphasis is on what it means when criticism comes from inside the coalition rather than from its usual opponents.",
      "The site summary frames the video as a story about movement discipline, factional instability, and how symbolic figures start speaking differently when they sense the political floor shifting.",

    date: "Apr 18, 2026",
    summary: [
      "This video appears to center on market influence, political messaging, and the optics of a president publicly boosting a specific stock. The framing suggests a critique of blurred lines between political power, media reach, and financial gain.",
      "For the site archive, it reads as a tighter analysis of how even a short post can become a larger story about influence, incentives, and whether the audience is watching politics or live market theater.",

    date: "Apr 17, 2026",
    summary: [
      "This episode is positioned like a reputational crisis story, taking an alleged leak and turning it into a broader look at White House vulnerability, image control, and political panic. The core idea is that personal narratives become governing problems once they break into the public arena.",
      "The on-site summary treats it as a commentary piece on damage control and the limits of message discipline when a story starts moving faster than the people trying to contain it.",

    date: "Apr 15, 2026",
    summary: [
      "This segment appears to focus on military depletion, deterrence, and what happens when a defense system starts looking finite instead of dependable. The title points to an argument about exposure: once an adversary understands the limits, every launch becomes a strategic countdown.",
      "For the website, the summary frames the episode as a clear geopolitical briefing about readiness, leverage, and the dangers of wars that become arithmetic as much as ideology.",

    date: "Apr 14, 2026",
    summary: [
      "This episode is framed like a warning about intelligence, escalation, and institutional denial. The title suggests a direct challenge to Pentagon credibility by pairing a severe allegation with an official dismissal that may not reassure viewers at all.",
      "On the site, the writeup presents it as a conflict-analysis video about what governments choose to acknowledge in public and what those choices signal to allies, adversaries, and the domestic audience.",

    summary: [
      "This segment reads as a breakdown of internal regime decay, with the IRGC's posture toward its own population used as evidence that the system is under strain from the inside. The focus is less on surface rhetoric and more on what coercion says about stability.",
      "The archive summary frames the episode as a political power analysis: when a regime redirects threat language inward, it can reveal weakness just as clearly as it projects force.",

    date: "Apr 12, 2026",
    summary: [
      "This episode is presented as a ceasefire-collapse story, with the use of cluster munitions serving as the proof point that a temporary pause was never politically durable. The framing suggests that diplomatic language can become obsolete almost immediately once battlefield incentives take over again.",
      "For the website, the summary treats it as a short-form strategic read on escalation, failed pauses, and how quickly a supposedly controlled conflict can outrun the people trying to choreograph it.",
